Introduction to the Project:

Electricity sector in the United States is becoming extremly vulnarable to supply inadequacy risks under projected climate change scenarios, urbanization, population shifts, among others. This project aims at forecasting the climate sensitive electricity load for the 11 Independent Systems Operator regions in the state of New York and compare the results of region specific climate sensitivities of load. 

I developed a framework that can best consider all weather parameters, price and socio-economic factors along with their interactions. Leveraged advanced algorithmic time series models to forecast the load for respective NYISO regions. Identified key climate factors that influence electricity demand in the respective NYISO regions.
